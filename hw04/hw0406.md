```c
#include <stdio.h>

#define Peval(cmd) printf(#cmd ": %g\n", cmd);

int main() {
    double *plist = (double[]){1, 2, 3};
    double list[] = {1, 2, 3};

    Peval(sizeof(plist) / (sizeof(double) + 0.0));
    Peval(sizeof(list) / (sizeof(double) + 0.0));
    return 0;
}
```

This code using  macros to print out the result & code of the expression.

Takes below code as example:

```c
#define STR(x) #x
```

When there comes a '#' before a macro parameter, it will be replaced by the string literal of the parameter.
In the example, the parameter is 'x', so the '#' will be replaced by the string literal of 'x'.

As for the output for the code at the top:

1. First line output 1, because the sizeof(plist) is the size of a pointer, which is 8 bytes, and the sizeof(double) is 8 bytes, so the result is 8 / 8 = 1.
2. Second line output 3, because the sizeof(list) is the size of the array, which is 24 bytes, and the sizeof(double) is 8 bytes, so the result is 24 / 8 = 3.
