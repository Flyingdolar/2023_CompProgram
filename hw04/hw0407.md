# 0407 BONUS: FILES

The file function in the shell will test all the argument type. Besides, it also read some additional property of the file. For example if I do as followings:

```bash
$ file hw0406.md
hw0406.md: C source, ASCII text
```

It shows that is a ASCII text and also contains some C source code inside.
By this case we can know that it read the content(or Header) to know more info about the file.

Above all, it come up with a conclusion that even if I change .md to .pdf, it will still show the same result.
